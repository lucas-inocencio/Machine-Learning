# Machine-Learning

This repository contains two projects devolepd using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn:

## Credit Approval Classifier

This project aims to build a classifier to support the credit approval decision. The classifier will identify among customers who apply for a credit product those who present a high risk of not being able to honor the payment, becoming defaulters. The project uses historical data of 20,000 requests for credit products that were approved by the institution. The data includes information about the applicants and the respective outcome. Based on this historical data, the classifier will predict whether a new credit request will result in a good or bad payer.

The dataset used in this project is provided by the institution and contains 20,000 historical records of approved credit requests, along with the respective outcome.

## Property Price Estimation with Multivariate Regression

This project aims to estimate the price of a property based on various characteristics such as the type of property, neighborhood, number of rooms, floor area, and presence of differentiating elements such as parking, swimming pool, and gym. The project uses multivariate regression techniques to estimate the price of the property.

The dataset used in this project contains information about properties such as the type of property, neighborhood, number of rooms, floor area, and presence of differentiating elements. The dataset also includes the price of the properties.
